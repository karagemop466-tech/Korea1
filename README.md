# NFL Line Lab

An auditable NFL line-origination and strategy-research dashboard.

**Current decision: no validated betting edge and no reward award.** The engine originates lines and
tests single bets, situational signals and parlays. Authenticated executable quotes and verified
player-prop ticket prices are missing, so the evidence does not support funding a strategy.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make build
make test
```

`make build` stages and hash-checks the pinned community archive, builds the canonical tables,
renders the root site and strict annex, and checks official/primary row references, blank unverified
metric cells, internal links, local assets and verdict logic. Normal builds do not move the pin.
An upstream refresh requires `python pipeline/fetch_data.py --refresh-pin` followed by a new audit.

The independent annex can be rebuilt with `PYTHON=.venv/bin/python make annex`.
Historical calculations remain in `data/lab/`; public annex tables do not present them as official facts.

## Evidence policy

Official NFL observations, primary method references, operator terms and community research inputs
are different evidence classes. Every public table row has an official/primary reference. Unverified
metric cells are blank and flagged. A hash proves file integrity, not that a community price was an
executable bookmaker offer. Model estimates are not official observations.

## Important repairs

The final audit fixed moving-pin builds, full-history weather fill, mismatched benchmark samples,
whole-week parlay lookahead, hard-coded/weak validation gates, iid bet-level inference, misleading
key-number pricing claims, and permissive source checking. See `audit/REPORT.md` and `flagged.html`.
