# Executive summary — NFL Line Lab

Final integration: 2026-11-02. Research snapshot: `9654533e5a0958726afcc076860f2c828ea0bf61`.

## Decision

**Keep the research engine; do not fund or reward a betting strategy yet.** The repository originates
NFL lines and evaluates single-bet, situational and parlay candidates. It does not contain authenticated,
timestamped executable bookmaker quotes or verified player-prop ticket prices. **0 of 18 canonical
strategies pass all eight final gates.** No prize, capital allocation or profitable recommendation is authorized.

“Unverified” is not a finding of zero edge. It means the evidence cannot support the stronger claim.
Statistical corrections reduce false discoveries; they cannot eliminate luck or guarantee future returns.

## Decision readiness follow-up — 2026-11-12

Three review registers sit in front of the research, generated from the same data as the pages, and none
of them is an approval:

| Register | Size / status | What it establishes |
|---|---|---|
| `suggestions.html` | 22 proposals — 8 ready now, 6 pilot, 4 recommended before any reward, 2 rejected, 1 deferred, 1 blocked | Cost, risk, dependency and acceptance evidence for every change, plus four paths (A–D) and a change-control worksheet |
| `decisions.html` | 12 readiness questions plus a parallel 8-proposal register | Current answers, missing inputs, discovery steps and the gate each one feeds |
| `questions.html` | 40 questions — 29 answered, 2 open, 7 blocked, 2 needing an owner decision | Every answer cited; blocked rows left blank with the reason and a closure test |

Two dated captures are transcribed exactly: the 2026 week-10 WAS/NYG report (20 rows — 2 Out, 1
Questionable, 17 blank) and 2019 week 5 (11 rows). 8 availability signals assessed: 1 available, 4 pilot-only, 2 open, 1 blocked — **0 in the leaderboard**, because none
clears the leakage and confirmation tests and the board is pinned before week 8.

The official source inventory holds 12 checks (9 verified, 3 verified-negative),
including **2 club depth charts** read on 2026-11-12. The league site has no depth-chart page and
its rosters are alphabetical, but the clubs publish charts, so a starter/backup *order* exists for those
clubs — 2 of 32 — with no publication time on either chart and no confirmed game-day role. No player
is called a confirmed replacement, no depth rank is invented for a player absent from a chart, and no
availability signal enters the model. A read-only daily Actions monitor archives the sources; collection is
not verified extraction. All-club coverage, game-day role confirmation and validated impact remain blocked.

## Update of 2026-11-12

| Area | Status | What changed and what it means | Official reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Injuries and lineups | Tracking live; effect not priced | A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow reads the official NFL.com injury report and each club's depth-chart page and publishes, for offense and defense, which first-listed players are Out or Doubtful and which 2nd, 3rd or 4th-string player the club lists next (`availability.html`). It does not yet move the originated line: the point value of an absence has not been measured. | [NFL injury report](https://www.nfl.com/injuries/) |
| Suggestions | Awaiting your decision | Every proposed change is on `decision-board.html` with options, a recommendation and the evidence behind it. Nothing is implemented. Decide DB-02 (real prices) and DB-03 (forward paper ledger) first. | [White (2000)](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2000/09/01/reality-check-data-snooping) |
| Open questions | Unanswered | `open-questions.html` separates what is known from what is missing and names how to find it. Some only you can answer: sportsbooks and jurisdiction, bankroll, success threshold, refresh cadence, reward. | [White (2000)](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2000/09/01/reality-check-data-snooping) |
| Line board freshness | Stale | The open line board still starts at Week 8 (snapshot pinned 2026-11-02); the injury capture is for the current week. Refreshing is suggestion DB-04. | [NFL schedule](https://www.nfl.com/schedules/) |
| Site | Repaired | Navigation grouped by category; stylesheet now defines the classes the pages use. Review findings RV-01 to RV-11 are on `flagged.html`. | [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages) |

## Material audit corrections

1. **Pinned reproduction:** normal builds now read the committed SHA. Refreshing upstream requires an explicit flag.
2. **No future weather fill:** missing observations stay blank. Weather and roof fields are excluded from the default model until pre-kickoff availability is verified.
3. **Fair benchmark comparison:** each model and market metric uses identical available games for that market.
4. **No whole-week parlay hindsight:** tickets use an earliest eligible simultaneous kickoff slate. They remain research simulations, not confirmed ticket offers.
5. **Discrete predictive probabilities:** prior out-of-fold empirical errors replace the claim that a normal continuity correction correctly prices key numbers.
6. **Dependence-aware inference:** weekly returns, shared stationary-bootstrap resampling and Holm correction replace bet-level independence and an unsupported FDR claim.
7. **Fail-closed verdicts:** all eight gates, including redundancy and official quote provenance, are required. A profitable backtest is not labelled skill.
8. **Trial-count uncertainty:** the complete exploratory search history is unknown. Deflated Sharpe is provisional and cannot certify a strategy.
9. **Source policy:** community hashes are not official NFL verification. Strict public tables blank unverified observations; historical calculations remain in labelled data downloads.
10. **Settlement conflicts:** three 2015 closing-file outcome flags conflict with NFL.com Game Center scores. The score file agrees with NFL.com; the conflicting price-file flags remain flagged.

## Reproduce and inspect

Run `make build` and `make test`. The canonical pipeline writes `data/processed/`; the independent
replication annex is preserved under `scripts/`, `data/lab/` and `lab/`. Public annex tables use the same
strict-source policy. Historical JSON/CSV calculations are explicitly unverified research data.

See `audit/REPORT.md`, `data/audit/`, `flagged.html` and `COORDINATION.md` for the audit scope,
conflicts, verification commands and final PR/deployment record. A code/data audit is not a claim that
every third-party historical observation has been individually authenticated.

**Research and education only. No guaranteed returns.**
