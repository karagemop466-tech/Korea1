Final integration: 2026-11-02; availability tracker, decision board and open questions added 2026-11-12. Research snapshot: `{src['upstream']['commit_sha']}`.

## Decision

**Keep the research engine; do not fund or reward a betting strategy yet.** The repository originates
NFL lines and evaluates single-bet, situational and parlay candidates. It does not contain authenticated,
timestamped executable bookmaker quotes or verified player-prop ticket prices. **{n} of {len(gates)} canonical
strategies pass all eight final gates.** No prize, capital allocation or profitable recommendation is authorized.

“Unverified” is not a finding of zero edge. It means the evidence cannot support the stronger claim.
Statistical corrections reduce false discoveries; they cannot eliminate luck or guarantee future returns.

## Update of 2026-11-12

| Area | Status | What changed and what it means | Official reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Injuries and lineups | Tracking live; effect not priced | A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow reads the official NFL.com injury report and each club's depth-chart page and publishes, for offense and defense, which first-listed players are Out or Doubtful and which 2nd, 3rd or 4th-string player the club lists next (`availability.html`). It does not yet move the originated line: the point value of an absence has not been measured. | [NFL injury report](https://www.nfl.com/injuries/) |
| Suggestions | Awaiting your decision | Every proposed change is on `decision-board.html` with options, a recommendation and the evidence behind it. Nothing is implemented. Decide DB-02 (real prices) and DB-03 (forward paper ledger) first. | [White (2000)](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2000/09/01/reality-check-data-snooping) |
| Open questions | Unanswered | `open-questions.html` separates what is known from what is missing and names how to find it. Some only you can answer: sportsbooks and jurisdiction, bankroll, success threshold, refresh cadence, reward. | [White (2000)](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2000/09/01/reality-check-data-snooping) |
| Line board freshness | Stale | The open line board still starts at Week 8 (snapshot pinned 2026-11-02); the injury capture is for the current week. Refreshing is suggestion DB-04. | [NFL schedule](https://www.nfl.com/schedules/) |
| Site | Repaired | Navigation grouped by category; stylesheet now defines the classes the pages use. Review findings RV-01 to RV-11 are on `flagged.html`. | [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages) |

## Decision readiness follow-up — 2026-11-12

The dedicated `decisions.html` register supplies twelve questions with current answers, missing inputs,
discovery steps and acceptance gates. `suggestions.html` compares eight proposed paths and alternatives;
none is approved. `lineups.html` contains seven selected official Week 10 injury-report observations
and quoted cells from two club depth charts, retrieved 2026-11-12. Unknown injury/status fields,
confirmed starter/replacement roles, replacement depth ranks and point impacts stay blank.
That sample page is not league-wide or live tracking; the league-wide scheduled capture is `availability.html` (table above). A daily read-only Actions monitor archives three official
source pages without promoting collection into verified extraction or changing model inputs.
Game-day role confirmation and validated player-impact signals remain blocked; all-club coverage is supplied by `availability.html`.

## Material audit corrections

1. **Pinned reproduction:** normal builds now read the committed SHA. Refreshing upstream requires an explicit flag.
2. **No future weather fill:** missing observations stay blank. Weather and roof fields are excluded from the default model until pre-kickoff availability is verified.
3. **Fair benchmark comparison:** each model and market metric uses identical available games for that market.
4. **No whole-week parlay hindsight:** tickets use an earliest eligible simultaneous kickoff slate. They remain research simulations, not confirmed ticket offers.
5. **Discrete predictive probabilities:** prior out-of-fold empirical errors replace the claim that a normal continuity correction correctly prices key numbers.
6. **Dependence-aware inference:** weekly returns, shared stationary-bootstrap resampling and Holm correction replace bet-level independence and an unsupported FDR claim.
7. **Fail-closed verdicts:** all eight gates, including redundancy and official quote provenance, are required. A profitable backtest is not labelled skill.
8. **Trial-count uncertainty:** the complete exploratory search history is unknown. Deflated Sharpe is provisional and cannot certify a strategy.
9. **Source policy:** community hashes are not official NFL verification. Strict public tables blank unverified observations; historical calculations remain in labelled data downloads.
10. **Settlement conflicts:** three 2015 closing-file outcome flags conflict with NFL.com Game Center scores. The score file agrees with NFL.com; the conflicting price-file flags remain flagged.

## What remains blocked

| Missing evidence | Consequence | Official context |
|---|---|---|
| Authenticated historical entry/closing quotes with timestamps and limits | No executable ROI or CLV validation | [NFL official scores](https://www.nfl.com/scores/) |
| Verified player-prop prices and joint SGP quotes | No prop-combo ROI or validated correlation | [NFL injury report](https://www.nfl.com/injuries/) |
| Complete trial registry and untouched prospective replication | No reward eligibility | [White (2000)](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2000/09/01/reality-check-data-snooping) |
| Full official census of historical scores and pregame fields | Research inputs remain only partially officially verified | [NFL official scores](https://www.nfl.com/scores/) |

## Reproduce and inspect

Run `make build` and `make test`. The canonical pipeline writes `data/processed/`; the independent
replication annex is preserved under `scripts/`, `data/lab/` and `lab/`. Public annex tables use the same
strict-source policy. Historical JSON/CSV calculations are explicitly unverified research data.

See `audit/REPORT.md`, `data/audit/`, `flagged.html` and `COORDINATION.md` for the audit scope,
conflicts, verification commands and final PR/deployment record. A code/data audit is not a claim that
every third-party historical observation has been individually authenticated.

**Research and education only. No guaranteed returns.**
